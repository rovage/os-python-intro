# Part 2

Starting with this line:

    some_fib = [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
    
get the list of numbers in some_fib that are either divisible by two or five.

Can you do this in one line?

# Part 2

While example

# Bonus
Write a "Fizzbuzz" function:
  * Input is a number
  * Output is counting up from 1 to your input number, except:
    * Multiples of 3 are replaced by "fizz"
    * Multiples of 5 are replaced by "buzz"
    * Multiples of both 3 and 5 are replaced by "fizzbuzz"
    
With input 16, example output would be:

    1
    2
    fizz
    4
    buzz
    fizz
    7
    8
    fizz
    buzz
    11
    fizz
    13
    14
    fizzbuzz
    16
    
Clue: % is the modulo function, and it will be useful...
