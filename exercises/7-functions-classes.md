# Part 1
* Set a global variable - "index" with value 4
* Write a function (print_me) that takes a number as an argument and prints "The number is x", where x is the number
* Write a function (print_index) that takes no argument and prints "The index is x", where x is the value of "index"
* Write a function (test_function) that:
    * Sets "index" to 999
    * Runs "print_me" with "index"
    * Runs "print_index"
* Run test_function. What happens?

# Part 2
Dogs have a names, a breed and a boolean flag to say whether they are friendly or not.
By default, dogs should be friendly. :)

* Create a Dog class with an instantiation function that sets the dog's name, breed and (optionally) friendliness 
* Write a "make_doggy_sound" method for the dog: 
    * If the dog is friendly, return "Woof!"
    * If the dog isn't so friendly, return a "Grrr..."
* Make a list and fill it with some dogs
  * Make some dogs friendly, some less friendly
  * Try explicitly naming the arguments and changing the order of arguments around
* Iterate through the list, and print the dog's name with its doggy sound
