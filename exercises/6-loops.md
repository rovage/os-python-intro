# Step 1

Loop the through the following list. Print the name of each film and the length of the film's title.

```
a_list_of_films = [
    "And Now for Something Completely Different",
    "The Holy Grail",
    "Life of Brian",
    "The Meaning of Life"
]
```

Beware that if you are trying to add a number to a string, Python gets confused (e.g. `"this is a string" + 10`). To get around this, use `str(x)` to convert the number to a string or use `format`.

# Step 2

Create a while loop that loops through the numbers from 1 to 10 and prints the number along with the number multiplied by 10. 

# Bonus

Starting with this line:

    some_fib = [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
    
Get the list of numbers in some_fib that are either divisible by two or five.

Can you do this in one line?
