# Step 1

Loop the through the following list. Print the name of each film and the length of the film's title.

```
a_list_of_films = [
    "And Now for Something Completely Different",
    "The Holy Grail",
    "Life of Brian",
    "The Meaning of Life"
]
```

Beware that if you are trying to add a number to a string, Python gets confused (e.g. `"this is a string" + 10`). To get around this, use `str(x)` to convert the number to a string or use `format`.

# Step 2

TODO

# Bonus

Create a while loop that returns the Fibonacci Sequence, up to 34.

The sequence starts from 0 and adds the last two numbers together. 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, ... 34.
