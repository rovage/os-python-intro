See [worksheet](../notes/3-list-worksheet.md).

# Part 2

Create a variable that is a list with the following values: 1, 29, 26, 26, 24

* There is an error in the list. Correct it by removing the last item in the list (24) and appending 23 instead.
* How many items are there in the list?
* [Sort the list](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists) so that it starts with 29 and ends with 1.
* Create a new variable that is a set of the unique values from the list.

What is wrong with the following statement?

```
a = [1, 3, 5]
a[len(a)]
```

What happens if you try to slice backwards? How do you make it work properly?

```
a2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
a2[0::-1]
```

What is wrong with the following statement?

```
t = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
t.append(6)
```

# Part 3

|Vance    | 1940|
|Graham   | 1942|
|Edward   | 1943|

* Add 'Bone' to the dictionary, with a value of 1943.
