# Part 1

Using the following variables:

```
x = 9
y = 15.0
```

Try to guess the results that you would get from running the statement. Then, try running the statement and see whether it gave you the expected result (there might be some surprises).

| Q    | Statement      | Guess | Result   |
|-----:| -------------- | ----- | -------- |
| 1    | `10 + 100 `    |       |          |
| 2    | `10 - 90 `     |       |          |
| 3    | `x * y `       |       |          |
| 4    | `x ** 2 `      |       |          |
| 5    | `0.1 * 3 `     |       |          |
| 6    | `9.0 / 30 `    |       |          |
| 7    | `2 / 5 `       |       |          |
| 8    | `x / 5 `       |       |          |
| 9    | `y / x `       |       |          |
| 10   | `"1" + "2" `   |       |          |
| 11   | `"0" * 2 `     |       |          |
| 12   | `m = 12` <br> `m += 1 ` <br> What is the new value of `m`?  |       |          |
| 13   | `n = 12` <br> `n -= 2 ` <br> What is the new value of `n`?  |       |          |

# Part 2

Why does the following statement throw an error? 

```
x = "3"
y = 4
print(x + y)
```

Correct the print line above to: 
* get the numbers to add together; and 
* get the strings to concatenate together.
