# Part 1

A Norwegian Blue is being sold in a shop in Ipswich. The shop has 1 in stock. The shop does deliveries within 250 miles.

A buyer wishes to order a Norwegian Blue. The buyer wants it delivered, and lives 208 miles away in Bolton.

Using the following variables:

```
item_stock = 1
order_quantity = 1
buyer_wants_delivery = True
maximum_delivery_distance = 250
buyers_distance_from_shop = 208
```

Write a separate if statements to check:
* whether the `order_quantity` matches the `item_stock`, then print "restock required"
* whether the `order_quantity` is less than or equal to the `item_stock`, then print "enough" otherwise print "out of stock"
* whether the `buyer_wants_delivery` and the `buyers_distance_from_shop` is less than the `maximum_delivery_distance`, then print "within"

# Part 2

Starting with this line:

    some_fib = [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
    
get the list of numbers in some_fib that are either divisible by two or five.

Can you do this in one line?
