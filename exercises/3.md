# Part 1

Create a variable that is a list with the following values: 1, 29, 26, 26, 23, 21, 18, 16, 13, 10, 8, 5, 3, 26

* There is an error in the list. Correct it by removing 26 from the end of the list and appending the 31 to the end of the list.
* How many items are there in the list, i.e. what is the list's length?
* Retrieve every other value from the list, starting from the second value. (result should be 29, 26, 21, ... 31)
* [Sort the list](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists) so that it starts with 31 and ends with 1.
* Create a new variable that is a set of the unique values from the list.

What is wrong with the following statement?

```
a = [1, 3, 5]
a[len(a)]
```

What happens if you try to slice backwards? How do you make it work properly?

```
a2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
a2[0::-1]
```

What is wrong with the following statement?

```
t = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
t.append(6)
```

What is wrong with the following statement?

```
d = {1:4,5:7,24:9}
d[2]
```

# Part 2
   
Create a dictionary the Middle as keys and YOB as the values:

| Middle  | YOB |
|---------|-----|
|Arthur   | 1941|
|Marwood  | 1939|
|Vance    | 1940|
|Graham   | 1942|
|Edward   | 1943|

* Add 'Bone' to the dictionary, with a value of 1943.
* What is the YOB for Graham?
